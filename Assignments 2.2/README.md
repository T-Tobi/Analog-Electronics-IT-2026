Diode I–V Characteristic (LTspice)

Name: Ashaolu OluwaTobiloba Sunday

Sweep range/step: 0 V to 15 V with a step of 0.1 V

Plot description: The plot shows the diode I–V characteristic, where the current remains very low at small voltages and then increases rapidly after the diode’s forward threshold (around 0.6–0.7 V).
