Review of Circuits and Systems

Question 8: Define Electricity and Electronics and Highlight the Key Differences
Electricity
Electricity is the study and use of electrical energy produced by the movement of electric charges (electrons). It mainly deals with generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electrical power.
In simple terms:
Electricity is about producing and using electrical power for tasks such as lighting, heating, and running machines.

Electronics
Electronics is a branch of science and engineering that deals with the controlled flow of electrons using devices such as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits to process information and control systems.
In simple terms:
Electronics uses small electrical signals to process data, control devices, and perform intelligent operations.

Key Differences Between Electricity and Electronics
Electricity Electronics
Deals with power and energy Deals with information and control
Uses high voltage and current Uses low voltage and current
Focuses on lighting, heating, motors Focuses on computers, phones, radios
Uses generators, transformers, motors Uses diodes, transistors, ICs
Concerned with power transmission Concerned with signal processing

Question 9: Electronic Device Example and Role of Electronics
Example: Smartphone
A smartphone works mainly because of electronics, not just electricity.
How Electronics Contribute
Electronics enable a smartphone to:
• Process information
• Store data
• Display images and videos
• Communicate wirelessly
• Respond to user input
Role of Key Electronic Components
Component Role
Microprocessor (CPU) Acts as the brain; processes all instructions
Transistors Work as switches and amplifiers
Integrated Circuits (ICs) Combine millions of components into one chip
Memory (RAM/ROM) Stores data and programs
Sensors Detect touch, motion, light, and sound
RF circuits Enable wireless communication
Power management ICs Control battery charging and power distribution
Summary:
Without electronics, a smartphone would only be a powered object.
Electronics make it smart, programmable, and interactive.
