Ideal vs Real Diode (LTspice DC Sweep)

Circuit: V1 → 1 kΩ → diode → GND  
Sweep: .dc V1 0 15 0.1

What I did
I simulated the same series diode circuit twice in LTspice. In the first schematic I used an “ideal” diode model (zero forward drop and very low ON resistance). In the second schematic I used a practical diode model (1N4148). For both cases I ran a DC sweep on V1 and plotted the diode current.

Comparison

The biggest visible difference is the turn-on voltage. The ideal diode begins to conduct almost immediately once the source voltage increases above 0 V, so the current rises quickly and is mainly limited by the 1 kΩ resistor. In contrast, the 1N4148 shows a clear forward threshold: current stays small at low voltages and then increases rapidly around roughly 0.6–0.7 V. After conduction begins, the real diode still has a forward drop that changes with current, so it does not behave like a perfect short circuit.

Ideal models are still useful because they make circuit behavior easy to understand and allow quick hand calculations without complex exponential equations. However, ideal models become inaccurate in low-voltage circuits, precision bias networks, and when power dissipation or switching behavior matters, because real diodes have forward voltage, leakage current, and non-ideal effects.
